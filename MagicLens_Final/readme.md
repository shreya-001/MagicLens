Abstract
The ‘Magic Lens’ project focuses on implementing a facial recognition system using machine learning, specifically targeting the identification of 5 individuals. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model achieved 72.2% accuracy on the test data, outperforming alternatives such as Random Forest and Logistic Regression. The selected SVM model is saved for future use to ensure global applicability, and a class dictionary associates individuals with landmarks. By leveraging pre-processing methods and SVM correction, this project advances facial recognition technology. The use of OpenCV, PyWavelets and scikit-learn ensures powerful functionality with Flask for back-end interaction and HTML, JavaScript and jQuery for front-end development. MySQL and PostgreSQL databases improve scalability and reliability. Overall, this collection of technologies combines machine learning with real-world applications, contributing to the successful deployment of highly accurate facial recognition systems.
