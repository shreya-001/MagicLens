# MagicLens

MagicLens is an application designed to serve as a personal photo classifier and
organizer with both frontend and backend components. The project's primary objective is
to facilitate users in efficiently managing and sorting their local photos based on
personalized criteria and preferences. The application uses advanced face and eye
detection to leverage the power of the OpenCV library. Machine learning algorithms,
including SVM, logistic regression, and random forest, enable personalized photo sorting
based on user-defined criteria. At the same time, deep learning plays a major role in
commercial applications. The project further emphasizes modularity by exporting the
model to a file and implementing a Python Flask server, ensuring seamless
communication with the user interface. The UI, developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
and JQuery, offers an intuitive and visually appealing platform for users to organize their
images effortlessly according to their preferences. MagicLens is a comprehensive
solution combining cutting-edge technologies to provide a user-centric and efficient.
